# convex-hull
Replicated the programming component of the research article “Mean Perimeter and Area of the Convex Hull of a Planar Brownian Motion in the Presence of Resetting” in julia programming language
◦ First developed a program that calculates the Convex hull from scratch  of some random points without using any packages and built-in functions with Julia programming language.
Then simulated the Brownian motion using random-walk and applied resetting rate and calculated perimeter and Area using Convex-hull of the particle.
Additionally, I implemented a supplementary visual simulation showing the final intensity distribution of perfume dispersion from a point based on Brownian motion principles.
